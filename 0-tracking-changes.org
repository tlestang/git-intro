* Making the initial commit

Let's work on a simple python script that reads, plot and fit CSV
data. We start by reading some example data:

#+begin_src python :tangle 0-tracking-changes/plot_data.py :exports code
  import numpy

  data = numpy.loadtxt("example_data.csv", delimiter=",")
#+end_src

=git status= outputs information about the state of our project. If we
try it we see that Git has nothing to report on.

#+begin_src shell
  git status
#+end_src

But we have a python script in the directory!? Git doesn't
automatically track all the files in a directory. We ask git to start
tracking our script:

#+begin_src shell
  git add plot_data.py
#+end_src

Now we can record the state of our file (make our first snapshot)

#+begin_src shell
  git commit
#+end_src

* Displaying changes

Let's plot our data using matplotlib

#+begin_src diff
  diff --git a/plot_data.py b/plot_data.py
  index 6027a65..d5affde 100644
  --- a/fit_data.py
  +++ b/fit_data.py
  @@ -1,3 +1,5 @@
   import numpy
  +import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   data = numpy.loadtxt("example_data.csv", delimiter=",")
  +plt.plot(data[:, 0], data[:, 1])
#+end_src

we can check the status of our repository

#+begin_src shell
  git status
#+end_src

This tells us that we modified ~fit_data.py~ since the last recorded
snapshot. We can ask git to print what changed since

#+begin_src shell
  git diff
#+end_src

* The staging area

Let's make two changes.

First, add a comment describing the two columns in the data file
=example_data.csv=:

#+begin_src diff :exports code
  diff --git a/0-tracking-changes/example_data.csv b/0-tracking-changes/example_data.csv

Second, modify the python script =plot_data.py= to add a title to the
figure:

#+begin_src diff :exports code
  diff --git a/0-tracking-changes/plot_data.py b/0-tracking-changes/plot_data.py

   plt.plot(data[0], data[1])
  +plt.title("A title")
#+end_src

Try to record a new version with =git commit=:

#+begin_src shell
  git commit
#+end_src

This time we don't get our editor and the output is the same that ~git
status~. Notice the last line:

#+begin_example
  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
#+end_example

Git makes use of the concept of the /staging area/ (otherwise known as
the /index/).  The staging area is an intermediate place between the
working directory and the database of recorded versions. To be
included in the next version, changes must be added to the staging
area first. By default, the staging area is empty: recording a version
with =git commit= doesn't make sense since this this version would be
no different than the previous one. In this case, Git does not add a
new version and instead print the output of =git status=, prompting
you to add changes to staging area.

Let's record a new version that includes the change you made to Python
script (adding a title to the figure), but not the change made to the
data file. Start by adding all changes made to the the Python script
=plot_data.py= to the staging area:

#+begin_src shell
  git add plot_data.py
#+end_src

Display the status of the repository:

#+begin_src shell
  git status
#+end_src

Next, display the current differences with

#+begin_src shell
  git diff
#+end_src

What does this output tells you about the behavior of =git diff=?

It was stated above that the =git diff= command outputs the
differences between the current working directory and the last
recorded snapshot. This is, in fact, inaccurate. The =git diff=
command outputs the differences between the working directory and the
last recorded snapshot, minus whatever changes are currently added in
the staging area, and therefore ready to be recorded in the next
version. In other words, =git diff= display *the differences between
the working directory and the next recorded version*.

Use =git diff= to display the content of the staging area:

#+begin_src shell
  git diff --staged
#+end_src

Finally, record a new version including the changes above:

#+begin_src shell
  git commit -m "Add a title to the figure"
#+end_src

Repeat the =git add/commit= procedure to record a new version
including the changes made to the data file =example_data.csv=.

* Displaying the log of changes

Git provides a wealth of tools to display and analyse the history of a
project. The main entry point to these functionalities is the =git
log= command.

#+begin_src shell :exports code
  git log
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :exports results
  git log -n 3
#+end_src

You go up and down the list by using the up and down arrow keys on
your keyboard. You can also use the space key to scroll throught one
page at a time. *To exit, press the =q= key*.

The =git log= command prints a list of all our versions
back to the first recorded one (known as the /root commit/). By
default, =git log= includes:

- Author and date.
- Commit message.
- Unique identifier.

Ask Git to print the changes associated to each commit:

#+begin_src shell :exports code
  git log --patch # (or -p)
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :exports results
  git log -p -3
#+end_src

* Git is line-oriented

Let's introduce a temporary variable to avoid hardcoing the name of
our data file in the call to ~loadtxt~.

#+begin_src diff
  diff --git a/plot_data.py b/plot_data.py
  index d5affde..1c37f09 100644
  --- a/fit_data.py
  +++ b/fit_data.py
  @@ -1,5 +1,6 @@
   import numpy
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  -data = np.loadtxt("example_data.csv", delimiter=",")
  +filename = "example_data.csv"
  +data = np.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=",")
   plt.plot(data[:, 0], data[:, 1])
#+end_src

Use =git diff= to visualise your changes:

#+begin_src shell
  git diff
#+end_src

Alternatively, you can use the =--stat= option to display the number
of lines added and removed -- among other things.

#+begin_src shell
  git diff --stat
#+end_src

Git counts two one line removed, and two lines added. Even though you
changes only part of a line, Git considers that the whole line
changed, replace by another one.

*Lesson: for Git, the smallest unit of change is the line.*
