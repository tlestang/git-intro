      <description>Version control is about tracking changes made to files. In Git, a version refers to a particular state of the project, and version control is achieved by frequently recording this state in a database of versions.
A useful analogy is to view Git as a special camera, with which you could take snapshots of your project. You start by taking a first picture of the collection of files that make your project: that&amp;rsquo;s your first version.</description>
